If else statements
===================

If else statements are similar to loops, you have a condition stated in the if statement, if the condition is met then the code inside the if statement is run, if the condition is not met then the code inside the else statement is run instead, its as simple as that.  Here is a simple if else statement:

if (n < 15) {
	System.out.println(“n is less than 15”);
} else {
	System.out.println(“n is greater than or equal to 15”);
}

So what should happen if n is equal to 15.  Well, since the condition in the if statement fails we must run the piece of code inside of the else statement, so the following will get printed out:

n is greater than or equal to 15
