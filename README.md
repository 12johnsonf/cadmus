A Primer in Java

## Contributing
Files are stored in the `src` folder. Please take care to maintain the naming schema. To contribute:

1. Create a GitHub (this website) account (free obviously)
2. Fork this repository
3. Make your changes either online, with the `edit` button or offline
4. Send a pull request

Pull requests must contain no more than 5 changed files, new files included.

## Sending Multiple Pull Requests
To send multiple pull requests, click the `edit` button on MY repository, make a change, and save to yours. This will create a new branch to your repository. You can, thus, send a new pull request with only that branch's changes.
