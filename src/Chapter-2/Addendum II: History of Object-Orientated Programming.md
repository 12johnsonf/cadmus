History of Object-Orientated Programming
===
Java's concept of classes and objects are nothing new. The original idea came from the need for computers to simulate real-world models. The first language to employ classes and objects was, in fact, called *Simula*. It was the first ever object-orientated language. It went on to influence *Smalltalk*, a language invented at Xerox PARC, which was also where the GUI was invented.
