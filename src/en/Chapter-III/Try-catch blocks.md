Try-catch blocks
===

Try typing this into Eclipse and see what happens:

```java
System.out.println(3/0);
```

If you have done this right, you should get a lot of red writing appearing in your console. This because dividing by 0 is not possible, and the computer comes up with an error. SO, if you were to input this into a program then god knows what might happen. Basically the computer will not know what to do and will ignore it. BUt, a good program designer will want to catch these errors and tell the user about what went wrong. To do this you will need a *try-catch block*.
